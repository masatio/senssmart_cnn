# Heart Failure Detection from synchronized PPG, PCG and SCG Signals using 1D CNNs

This project investigates the use of **mechanical cardiac signals** for **automatic heart failure detection**, aiming to provide a low-cost, non-invasive, and widely deployable diagnostic tool. By applying deep learning to raw PPG beats, we evaluate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for distinguishing heart failure patients from healthy subjects.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** tailored for PPG signal classification.  
- Evaluated performance on **13,550 segmented PPG, PCG, and SCG beats**.  
- Compared different preprocessing strategies to optimize model robustness.  
- Demonstrated that non-invasively aquired signals can reliably support **cardiac diagnostics** when combined with deep learning.

## Dataset
- **PPG, PCG and SCG recordings** acquired from clinical subjects. 
- Dataset includes both **heart failure patients** and **control group**.
